                <p>This case, often called the <strong>Right to Privacy Case</strong>, arose from petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the government's Aadhaar scheme, which collected biometric data. During the hearings, the government argued that the Constitution does not grant a specific fundamental right to privacy. They relied on two earlier judgments, <em>M.P. Sharma</em> (1954) and <em>Kharak Singh</em> (1962), which had held that privacy was not a fundamental right.</p>
                <p>Due to the conflicting judgments that followed (which had read privacy into Article 21), a 5-judge bench referred this core question to a 9-judge bench to authoritatively determine whether privacy is a fundamental right under the Indian Constitution.</p>

                            <h4>Supreme Court Judgment</h4>
                            <p>The 9-judge bench unanimously holds that the Right to Privacy is a fundamental right protected under the Constitution.</p>

                </div>

                <p>In a historic, unanimous 9-0 judgment (with six separate concurring opinions), the Supreme Court held that the <strong>Right to Privacy is a fundamental right</strong>. The Court ruled that privacy is an intrinsic part of the Right to Life and Personal Liberty under <strong>Article 21</strong> and is also inherent in the other fundamental freedoms guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution.</p>
                <p>This judgment explicitly <strong>overruled</strong> the previous judgments in <em>M.P. Sharma</em> (1954) and <em>Kharak Singh</em> (1962) to the extent that they held privacy was not a fundamental right. The Court clarified that privacy is a natural right that is essential for human dignity and autonomy. However, it also stated that this right is not absolute and any state infringement upon it must pass a three-fold test: (i) it must be based on a valid law, (ii) it must be for a legitimate state aim, and (iii) it must be proportionate.</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>The six concurring judgments, though arriving at the same conclusion, explored different facets of privacy. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud's lead opinion emphasized privacy as a right to "self-determination" and essential for one's identity. Justice Chelameswar linked privacy to the "pursuit of happiness." Justice Nariman confirmed the overruling of the previous cases and affirmed the link between privacy and dignity. Justice Kaul highlighted the implications for informational privacy in the digital age. Collectively, the judgments rejected the government's argument that privacy was an "elitist" concept, firmly establishing it as a universal right necessary for a meaningful life. This judgment reset the foundation of constitutional law in India, strengthening individual liberties against state intrusion.</p>

                        <li>The right to privacy is not absolute; any invasion must be based on a law, meet a legitimate state aim, and be proportional to that aim.</li>

                    <p>The Right to Privacy is an inherent and inalienable right, essential for the autonomy and dignity of an individual. It is a fundamental right protected under Article 21 (as part of the right to life and personal liberty) and as an intrinsic component of the freedoms guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution.
