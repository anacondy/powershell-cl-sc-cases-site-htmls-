                <p>This landmark PIL challenged the long-standing tradition of the Sabarimala Ayyappa Temple in Kerala, which barred women in their "menstruating years" (defined as ages 10 to 50) from entry. The restriction was enforced under Rule 3(b) of the Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Rules, 1965.</p>
                <p>The petitioners argued that this practice was a form of gender discrimination, violated the right to equality (Article 14), non-discrimination (Article 15), freedom of religion (Article 25), and the right to life with dignity (Article 21). They also argued it was a form of "untouchability" under Article 17. The core issue was whether this practice constituted an "essential religious practice" protected under the Constitution, and whether the Ayyappa devotees constituted a separate religious denomination with rights under Article 26.</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>The practice is discriminatory on its face, as it excludes women based on their gender and a physiological function (menstruation), violating Articles 14 and 15.</li>
                                <li>It violates women's right to practice their religion freely under Article 25.</li>
                                <li>Exclusion based on notions of "purity and pollution" (menstruation) is a form of untouchability, banned by Article 17.</li>
                                <li>The practice is not an "essential religious practice" of Hinduism, as devotion to Lord Ayyappa is practiced by women elsewhere without this restriction.</li>
                                <li>The Ayyappa devotees are not a separate "religious denomination" and thus cannot claim the protection of Article 26 to manage their affairs in this manner.</li>

                                <li>The practice is not discriminatory against women in general, but is a specific restriction based on the celibate (<em>Naishtika Brahmachari</em>) nature of the deity, Lord Ayyappa.</li>
                                <li>This tradition is an "essential religious practice" integral to the faith of Sabarimala devotees, protected under Article 25(1).</li>
                                <li>The devotees of the Sabarimala deity form a distinct "religious denomination" (or at least a section thereof) and have the right to manage their own affairs in matters of religion under Article 26(b).</li>
                                <li>The exclusion is not based on "untouchability" under Article 17, which relates to caste-based discrimination.</li>
                                <li>Courts should not interfere in matters of deep-rooted religious faith.</li>

                <p>The Supreme Court, by a 4:1 majority, held that the practice of excluding women aged 10-50 from the Sabarimala Temple was <strong>unconstitutional</strong>. The majority opinions found that the practice violated multiple fundamental rights.</p>
                <p>The Court struck down Rule 3(b) of the Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship Rules as unconstitutional. The majority held that the practice was discriminatory, violated the right to equality (Article 14), the right against discrimination (Article 15), and the right of women to worship (Article 25). Justice Chandrachud also held it to be a form of untouchability under Article 17. The Court ruled that the Ayyappa devotees did not constitute a separate religious denomination and, in any case, the practice was not an "essential religious practice" protected by the Constitution. <strong>Justice Indu Malhotra</strong> delivered a powerful dissent, arguing that courts should not interfere in matters of deep religious faith and that the practice was not based on gender discrimination but on the unique character of the deity.</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>The majority judgments (Misra CJI, Nariman, Chandrachud JJ.) focused on "constitutional morality" overriding religious or social morality. They held that devotion cannot be subject to gender discrimination and that biological factors (like menstruation) cannot be used to deny constitutional rights. Justice Chandrachud's opinion, in particular, argued that excluding women based on menstrual status stigmatized them and was a form of untouchability. The majority concluded that the practice subordinated women to a "lower" status based on patriarchy. Justice Malhotra's dissent, however, argued for religious pluralism, stating that Article 25 protects practices of all faiths, even if they seem irrational to outsiders. She argued that the Ayyappa devotees <em>did</em> form a specific religious denomination and that the practice was essential to their faith, thus protected by Article 26.</p>

                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>(Majority View): The exclusion of women based on their menstrual age from a public place of worship is a form of gender discrimination that violates the core principles of equality (Article 14), non-discrimination (Article 15), and dignity (Article 21). Devotion is a fundamental right under Article 25 and cannot be denied to women based on a biological trait. This practice is not an "essential religious practice" and is not protected under Article 25 or 26. Constitutional morality must prevail over religious practices that are discriminatory.</p>
