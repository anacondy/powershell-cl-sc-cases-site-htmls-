                <p>This case, popularly known as the <strong>Ayodhya Title Dispute</strong>, was one of the most complex and longest-running legal battles in India's history. It centered on the ownership of 2.77 acres of disputed land in Ayodhya, claimed by Hindu parties as the birthplace of Lord Ram (Ram Janmabhoomi) and by Muslim parties as the site of the Babri Masjid (built in 1528, demolished in 1992).</p>
                <p>The Supreme Court was hearing appeals against the 2010 Allahabad High Court judgment, which had divided the disputed land in a 2:1 ratio among three parties: Ram Lalla Virajman (the deity), the Nirmohi Akhara, and the Sunni Central Waqf Board. The Supreme Court bench heard the arguments in a marathon 40-day hearing.</p>

                <p>The Supreme Court, in a unanimous 1045-page judgment, <strong>overruled the Allahabad High Court's 2010 decision</strong> to split the land. The Court held that the title to the entire 2.77 acres of disputed land belonged to the deity <strong>Ram Lalla Virajman</strong> (represented by his "next friend").</p>
                <p>The Court directed the Central Government to formulate a scheme and create a <strong>Trust</strong> within three months to build a Ram Temple on the site. Simultaneously, the Court invoked its extraordinary powers under <strong>Article 142</strong> (to do "complete justice") and acknowledged the "egregious wrong" of the 1992 mosque demolition. To remedy this, it directed the government to allot a <strong>separate, prominent 5-acre plot of land</strong> to the Sunni Central Waqf Board elsewhere in Ayodhya for the construction of a new mosque.</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>The Court's unanimous judgment (authored by the bench, with an anonymous addendum) was primarily a title suit decision based on "preponderance of probabilities." It held that the evidence from Hindu parties (travelogues, archaeological findings from ASI, continuous worship in the outer courtyard) showed a more consistent and possessory claim over the site than the Muslim parties, whose evidence of exclusive possession from 1528 to 1857 was weak. The Court noted the ASI report indicated a "non-Islamic" structure existed beneath the mosque, though it did not conclude it was a demolished temple. It dismissed the suit by Nirmohi Akhara as time-barred and barred by limitation. The decision to grant the land to the Hindu deity while simultaneously providing land for a mosque under Article 142 was a significant act of judicial balancing, aimed at providing closure to a long-standing national dispute while acknowledging the wrongs committed against the Muslim community.</p>

                    <h4>FINAL VERDICT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The 2010 Allahabad High Court judgment dividing the land was overruled as unworkable.</li>
                        <li>The title to the entire 2.77 acres of disputed land was awarded to the deity, <strong>Ram Lalla Virajman</strong>.</li>
                        <li>The Central Government was directed to form a <strong>Trust</strong> within 3 months to manage the land and oversee the construction of a Ram Temple.</li>
                        <li>The suit filed by the Nirmohi Akhara was dismissed as time-barred.</li>
                        <li>Invoking Article 142, the Court directed that a "suitable prominent plot" of <strong>5 acres</strong> be allotted to the <strong>Sunni Central Waqf Board</strong> in Ayodhya for building a mosque.</li>
                        <li>The demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 was declared an "egregious violation of the rule of law."</li>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>On a balance of probabilities, the evidence for the Hindu parties' claim to the disputed site, based on continuous worship and belief in the site as the birthplace of Lord Ram, was found to be stronger than the Muslim parties' claim based on title and adverse possession. The 2010 High Court decree for a three-way partition was legally unsustainable. While granting the title to the Hindu deity, the Court must use its powers under Article 142 to ensure "complete justice" and remedy the illegal destruction of the mosque by providing land for its reconstruction elsewhere.</p>
