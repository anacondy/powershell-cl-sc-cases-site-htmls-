                <p>This case, also known as the <strong>Ninth Schedule Case</strong>, was referred to a 9-judge bench to resolve a critical constitutional question: Does Article 31B, which gives laws in the Ninth Schedule blanket immunity from judicial review, extend to laws that violate the Basic Structure of the Constitution? The <em>Kesavananda Bharati</em> case had established the Basic Structure doctrine, and the <em>Waman Rao</em> case had held that amendments to the 9th Schedule <em>after</em> the <em>Kesavananda</em> judgment (April 24, 1973) could be challenged.</p>
                <p>This case aimed to definitively settle the scope of this challenge. Specifically, it examined whether laws placed in the 9th Schedule after 1973 could be tested against the Fundamental Rights (like Articles 14, 19, 21) which form a core part of the Basic Structure. The challenge arose from various laws, including a Tamil Nadu Act providing 69% reservation, which was placed in the 9th Schedule to protect it from being struck down for exceeding the 50% ceiling set in <em>Indra Sawhney</em>.</p>

                            <h4>Supreme Court Judgment (I.R. Coelho)</h4>
                            <p>The 9-judge bench unanimously holds that all laws placed in the 9th Schedule after April 24, 1973, are subject to judicial review for violating the Basic Structure.</p>

                <p>The Supreme Court, in a unanimous 9-judge decision, delivered a powerful judgment that cemented the supremacy of the Basic Structure doctrine. The Court held that <strong>all laws placed in the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973</strong> (the date of the <em>Kesavananda Bharati</em> judgment) are <strong>open to challenge</strong> in court.</p>
                <p>The Court ruled that the protective blanket of Article 31B does not provide absolute immunity. If a law added to the 9th Schedule is shown to abrogate or destroy the Basic Structure of the Constitution, it can be struck down by the courts. The Court clarified that Fundamental Rights (like Articles 14, 15, 19, 21) form the core of the Basic Structure, and any law that infringes upon their "essence" cannot be protected, even by the 9th Schedule.</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>The Court's analysis, delivered by CJI Sabharwal, created a two-part test. First, a law placed in the 9th Schedule must be examined to see if it infringes upon any Fundamental Rights. If it does, the Court must then determine if this infringement violates the <strong>Basic Structure</strong> of the Constitution. If it does, the law will be struck down. The Court explained that the "golden triangle" of Articles 14 (Equality), 19 (Freedoms), and 21 (Life and Liberty) is a key part of the Basic Structure. This judgment closed a potential loophole, ensuring that Parliament could not bypass the Basic Structure doctrine simply by using its amending power to place unconstitutional laws in the 9th Schedule. It established that judicial review, as part of the Basic Structure, applies to all laws, regardless of their purported immunity.</p>

                    <h4>FINAL VERDICT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All laws inserted into the 9th Schedule <strong>on or after April 24, 1973</strong> (the date of the <em>Kesavananda Bharati</em> judgment) are subject to judicial review.</li>
                        <li>Such laws can be challenged on the ground that they violate the <strong>Basic Structure</strong> of the Constitution.</li>
                        <li>The "essence" of Fundamental Rights under Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21 forms a key part of the Basic Structure.</li>
                        <li>If a law in the 9th Schedule (post-1973) is found to damage or destroy the Basic Structure, it will be struck down as unconstitutional.</li>
                        <li>The 9th Schedule's immunity under Article 31B is not absolute and does not protect against violations of the Basic Structure.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>The power of Parliament to amend the Constitution under Article 368 is limited by the Basic Structure doctrine. Placing a law in the 9th Schedule (which itself requires a constitutional amendment) does not exempt that law from the scrutiny of the Basic Structure test. All laws added to the 9th Schedule after April 24, 1973, must be tested against the principles of the Basic Structure. If a law infringes the "essence" of any Fundamental Right (which are part of the Basic Structure), it can be declared unconstitutional even if it is in the 9th Schedule.</p>
