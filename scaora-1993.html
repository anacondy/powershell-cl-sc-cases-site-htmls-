                <p>Popularly known as the <strong>Second Judges Case</strong>, this landmark Public Interest Litigation directly sought a reconsideration of the majority view in <em>S.P. Gupta v. Union of India</em> (First Judges Case), which had held that the executive had primacy over the judiciary in the appointment and transfer of judges. The petitioners argued that the <em>S.P. Gupta</em> ruling had detrimentally affected judicial independence.</p>
                <p>The core issue before the 9-judge bench was the interpretation of the word "consultation" in Articles 124(2) and 217(1) concerning appointments to the higher judiciary. Did it imply mere seeking of opinion (as held in <em>S.P. Gupta</em>), or did it require concurrence or give primacy to the opinion of the Chief Justice of India (CJI)? The case aimed to establish a framework that best preserved judicial independence, considered a basic feature of the Constitution.</p>

                <p>In a landmark 7:2 majority decision, the Supreme Court <strong>overruled</strong> its earlier judgment in <em>S.P. Gupta</em> regarding the primacy in judicial appointments. The Court held that <strong>judicial independence</strong>, being a basic feature of the Constitution, required <strong>primacy of the judiciary's opinion</strong> in appointments and transfers.</p>
                <p>The majority re-interpreted "consultation" under Articles 124(2) and 217(1) to mean <strong>concurrence</strong>. It established the <strong>Collegium system</strong>, ruling that the opinion of the Chief Justice of India, formed after consulting the two senior-most Supreme Court judges (later expanded in the Third Judges Case), would have primacy. The executive could object to a recommendation, but if the Collegium reiterated it, the appointment was binding. Similar principles were laid down for High Court appointments (involving consultation with HC collegium) and transfers.</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>Justice J.S. Verma, writing the leading majority opinion, emphasized that judicial independence, essential for upholding the rule of law and constitutionalism, necessitated insulating appointments from executive dominance. The Court reasoned that the judiciary itself was best equipped to assess the suitability and merit of candidates for judgeship. By interpreting "consultation" dynamically and purposively in the context of safeguarding judicial independence (Article 50), the majority shifted the balance of power decisively towards the judiciary. The creation of the Collegium aimed to make the CJI's recommendation an institutional opinion, not just a personal one. The dissenting judges (Ahmadi and Punchhi JJ.) strongly argued that this interpretation amounted to rewriting the Constitution, lacked textual basis, and created an opaque system without adequate checks and balances.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The majority view in <em>S.P. Gupta v. Union of India</em> regarding executive primacy in judicial appointments was overruled.</li>
                        <li>The opinion of the Chief Justice of India, formed through the collegium process, has <strong>primacy</strong> in judicial appointments and transfers.</li>

                        <li>The <strong>Collegium system</strong> was established, requiring the CJI to consult senior-most judges (initially two for SC appointments) to form an institutional opinion.</li>
                        <li>Recommendations reiterated by the Collegium after executive objection are binding.</li>
                        <li>Detailed guidelines were laid down for appointments and transfers to SC and HCs.</li>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>Judicial independence is a basic feature of the Constitution. To secure this independence, the <strong>primacy</strong> in the matter of appointments of judges to the Supreme Court and High Courts must rest with the judiciary. The term "consultation" under Articles 124(2) and 217(1) requires <strong>concurrence</strong> from the Chief Justice of India, whose opinion must be formed collectively with senior judges (the Collegium), representing the institutional view of the judiciary.</p>
                    <p><em>(Note: The Collegium system established here was further elaborated in the Third Judges Case (1998). An attempt to replace it with the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) via the 99th Amendment was struck down by the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judges Case (SCAORA v. UOI, 2015), reaffirming the Collegium's primacy based on the Basic Structure doctrine.)</em></p>
