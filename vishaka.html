                <p>This Public Interest Litigation was filed by several women's rights groups and NGOs, led by 'Vishaka', following the brutal gang rape of Bhanwari Devi, a social worker in Rajasthan, who was trying to stop a child marriage. The incident exposed the significant risks of sexual harassment faced by women at their workplaces, especially in the absence of any specific law to address it.</p>
                <p>The petition argued that sexual harassment in the workplace violated the fundamental rights to equality, non-discrimination, life with dignity, and the freedom to practice any profession (Articles 14, 15, 21, and 19(1)(g)). The core issue was the lack of any domestic law to prevent and redress this problem, creating a legal vacuum.</p>

                            <h4>Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act</h4>
                            <p>Parliament passes the "PoSH Act", giving statutory backing to the Vishaka Guidelines, 16 years after the judgment.</p>
                            <span class="date">2013</span>
                        </div>

                </div>

                <p>The Supreme Court delivered a unanimous and groundbreaking judgment, authored by CJI J.S. Verma. The Court explicitly recognized sexual harassment at the workplace as a violation of fundamental rights, particularly Articles 14, 15, and 21. It held that the right to life with dignity and the right to practice a profession in a safe environment were severely compromised by such harassment.</p>
                <p>Most importantly, acknowledging the <strong>"legislative vacuum"</strong> (the absence of a specific law), the Court invoked its power under Article 32 and drew upon international conventions (like CEDAW) that India had ratified. It laid down a set of binding guidelines, known as the <strong>"Vishaka Guidelines"</strong>, for all employers (public and private) to follow to prevent and address sexual harassment. These guidelines were declared to be the law of the land until Parliament enacted a suitable law, which finally happened in 2013 (the PoSH Act).</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>The Court's analysis was a remarkable example of judicial activism in response to a clear gap in the law. It established that international conventions, if not inconsistent with domestic law, can be read into the Fundamental Rights provisions to enlarge their scope, particularly in areas where no domestic law exists. This move effectively made international law enforceable in domestic courts via the Constitution. The Court defined sexual harassment and mandated practical, preventative, and remedial measures, including the formation of an <strong>Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)</strong> in every workplace, headed by a woman, with external NGO representation. This provided an immediate and enforceable mechanism for justice, filling the void left by the legislature.</p>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>FINAL VERDICT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sexual harassment at the workplace is a violation of Fundamental Rights under Articles 14, 15, 19(1)(g), and 21.</li>
                        <li>In the absence of domestic law, international conventions (like CEDAW) can be used to interpret and enforce Fundamental Rights.</li>
                        <li>The Court, under Article 32, issued binding directions known as the <strong>"Vishaka Guidelines"</strong> for all employers/establishments.</li>
                        <li>Key guidelines included:
                            <ul>
                                <li>A clear definition of sexual harassment.</li>
                                <li>Duty of employers to prevent harassment.</li>
                                <li>Establishment of an <strong>Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)</strong> in every workplace to handle complaints.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>These guidelines were declared to be law under Article 141, binding until Parliament enacted a specific statute.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>Gender equality includes protection from sexual harassment and the right to work with dignity, which is a universally recognized basic human right. The fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 15, 19(1)(g), and 21 of the Constitution are violated by sexual harassment at the workplace. In the absence of domestic legislation, international conventions and norms (like CEDAW) can be read into these fundamental rights to make them effective and enforceable by the Court under Article 32.</p>
