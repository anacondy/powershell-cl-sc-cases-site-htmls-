                <p>Popularly known as the <strong>Mandal Commission Case</strong>, this landmark judgment dealt with the constitutional validity of reservations for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in government jobs. The case arose from challenges to two Office Memorandums issued by the Government of India in 1990 and 1991, which sought to implement the recommendations of the Second Backward Classes Commission (Mandal Commission) by reserving 27% of posts for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBCs).</p>
                <p>The 1991 memorandum also introduced a 10% reservation for economically backward sections among the forward castes. A 9-judge bench was constituted to examine the complex issues surrounding reservations, including the scope of Article 16(4), the criteria for identifying backward classes, the total limit on reservations, and reservations in promotions.</p>

                            <p>The 9-judge bench delivers its landmark judgment, upholding OBC reservation with conditions (50% ceiling, creamy layer exclusion) but striking down the 10% EWS quota.</p>

                </div>

                <p>The Supreme Court, by a 6:3 majority on most issues, delivered a comprehensive judgment laying down the law on reservations. It upheld the <strong>constitutional validity of providing 27% reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBCs or OBCs)</strong> under Article 16(4), based on the Mandal Commission report, subject to certain conditions.</p>
                <p>Key rulings included:
                1. Backwardness under Article 16(4) must be <strong>social and educational</strong>, not just economic. Caste can be used as <em>a</em> criterion (often a starting point) for identifying SEBCs, but it cannot be the sole criterion.
                2. Article 16(4) is <strong>not an exception</strong> to Article 16(1) but an instance of classification implicit in it, enabling substantive equality.
                3. The <strong>"creamy layer"</strong> (socially advanced members) within the backward classes must be excluded from the benefit of reservation.
                4. Total reservations should <strong>not exceed 50%</strong> in any given year (reaffirming the rule from <em>M.R. Balaji</em>), except in extraordinary situations.
                5. Reservations <strong>should not apply to promotions</strong> (this was later modified by constitutional amendments).
                6. The <strong>10% reservation for economically backward sections</strong> among forward castes was struck down as unconstitutional, as Article 16(4) only permitted reservation based on social and educational backwardness, not purely economic criteria. (This is distinct from the later 103rd Amendment providing for EWS reservation under Articles 15(6) and 16(6)).</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy's lead majority opinion navigated the complex interplay between formal equality (Article 16(1)) and substantive equality (Article 16(4)). The Court acknowledged caste as a significant factor in Indian social reality, permitting its use in identifying backwardness while cautioning against it being the sole basis. The introduction of the 'creamy layer' concept was a crucial balancing act, aiming to ensure that reservations benefit the genuinely disadvantaged within the backward classes. The affirmation of the 50% ceiling aimed to balance the interests of reserved categories with those of the general category and maintain administrative efficiency. The striking down of the purely economic reservation highlighted the specific scope of Article 16(4) as it stood then. The judgment attempted to create a comprehensive framework, balancing affirmative action with principles of merit and equality, though debates on its implementation and nuances continue.</p>

                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>Article 16(4) permits reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services under the State. Backwardness contemplated under Article 16(4) is primarily social and educational, though economic backwardness may contribute to or result from it. Caste can be a permissible criterion for identifying backward classes but cannot be the sole criterion. Reservations under Article 16(4) must exclude the "creamy layer" and should generally be limited to a maximum of 50% of available posts in a year. Article 16(4) does not permit reservations in promotions. Reservation cannot be based solely on economic criteria under Article 16(4).</p>
                    <p><em>(Note: The aspect regarding reservations in promotions was later amended by the Constitution (77th, 81st, 82nd, 85th) Amendments. The aspect regarding purely economic reservation was addressed by the Constitution (103rd) Amendment, 2019, inserting Articles 15(6) and 16(6), whose validity was upheld in Janhit Abhiyan v. Union Of India, 2022).</em></p>
