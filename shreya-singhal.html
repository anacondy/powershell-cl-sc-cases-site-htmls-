                <p>This landmark PIL was filed by law student Shreya Singhal following the arrest of two young women in Maharashtra for a Facebook post criticizing the shutdown for Bal Thackeray's funeral. The case challenged the constitutional validity of <strong>Section 66A</strong> of the Information Technology Act, 2000.</p>
                <p>Section 66A criminalized sending "offensive" or "menacing" messages, or messages causing "annoyance" or "inconvenience," via computers or communication devices. The petitioners argued that the law was dangerously vague, overly broad, and had a "chilling effect" on the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a).</p>

                                <li>The language of Section 66A (e.g., "offensive," "annoyance," "inconvenience") is unconstitutionally <strong>vague</strong>. Citizens cannot know what is legal and what is not.</li>
                                <li>The provision is <strong>overbroad</strong>, criminalizing protected speech (like simple criticism or dissent) along with unprotected speech (like incitement).</li>
                                <li>It creates a "chilling effect" on free speech, as people will self-censor out of fear of arbitrary arrest.</li>
                                <li>The restrictions imposed do not fall under any of the "reasonable restrictions" (like public order, defamation, incitement to an offence) listed in Article 19(2).</li>
                                <li>It violates Article 14 by treating online speech differently and more harshly than offline speech.</li>

                                <li>The possibility of misuse of a law does not make the law itself unconstitutional; guidelines can be issued.</li>

                            <h4>Supreme Court Judgment</h4>
                            <p>The bench delivers a unanimous judgment, striking down Section 66A of the IT Act in its entirety as unconstitutional.</p>
                            <span class="date">March 24, 2015</span>

                <p>The Supreme Court, in a unanimous judgment authored by Justice R.F. Nariman, <strong>struck down Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, in its entirety</strong>, declaring it unconstitutional. The Court found that the provision violated the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) and was not saved by the reasonable restrictions in Article 19(2).</p>
                <p>The Court held that the section's prohibitions (based on terms like "annoyance," "inconvenience," "offensive," "menacing") were incurably <strong>vague</strong> and <strong>overbroad</strong>. This vagueness meant that a citizen could not know what was criminal and what was not, and the law could be arbitrarily applied by law enforcement. This created a "chilling effect" on free speech. The Court also held that the law failed to distinguish between mere discussion/advocacy (which is protected) and incitement (which can be restricted), making it an invalid restriction on speech.</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>Justice Nariman's judgment provided a robust defense of free speech in the digital age. It clearly differentiated between "discussion," "advocacy," and "incitement," holding that only speech amounting to "incitement" could be restricted under "public order." Section 66A, by criminalizing "annoyance," went far beyond this and was thus unconnected to public order. The Court rejected the government's argument that it should "read down" the provision, stating its flaws were too fundamental. While striking down Section 66A, the Court <strong>upheld the validity of Section 69A</strong> (power to block websites) and the rules under <strong>Section 79</strong> (safe harbor for intermediaries), finding their procedural safeguards reasonable. The judgment is celebrated for applying traditional free speech principles (like the vagueness doctrine) to modern technology and protecting online dissent.</p>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>FINAL VERDICT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, is declared <strong>unconstitutional and void</strong> in its entirety.</li>
                        <li>The provision violates the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a).</li>
                        <li>The restrictions imposed by Section 66A are not "reasonable" and do not fall under any of the protected categories in Article 19(2) (like public order, defamation, etc.).</li>
                        <li>The terms used in Section 66A are unconstitutionally <strong>vague</strong> and <strong>overbroad</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Section 69A (blocking power) and Section 79 (intermediary liability rules) were held to be constitutionally valid.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>The right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) is paramount, and any restriction on it under Article 19(2) must be narrow, precise, and not vague or overbroad. A law (like Section 66A) that uses ambiguous terms like "annoyance" or "offensive" fails the test of vagueness, as it does not provide clear standards for citizens or authorities. Such a law creates a "chilling effect" on protected speech. Furthermore, a restriction on speech can only be justified if it has a direct proximate connection to one of the grounds in Article 19(2) (e.g., incitement to violence for "public order"), which Section 66A failed to do.</p>
