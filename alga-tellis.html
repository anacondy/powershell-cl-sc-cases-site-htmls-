                <p>This landmark Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed on behalf of pavement and slum dwellers in Bombay (now Mumbai) who were facing eviction by the Bombay Municipal Corporation (BMC) under Section 314 of the BMC Act, 1888. The petitioners argued that eviction without resettlement would deprive them of their livelihood, which they contended was an integral part of the Right to Life guaranteed under Article 21.</p>
                <p>The case raised fundamental questions about the scope of Article 21, the conflict between the right to livelihood and laws against encroachment, and the application of principles like estoppel and natural justice in the context of mass evictions of the urban poor.</p>

                                <li>The right to life under Article 21 includes the right to livelihood, as deprivation of livelihood effectively amounts to deprivation of life.</li>
                                <li>Evicting pavement dwellers from their place of residence near their place of work, without providing alternatives, violates their right to livelihood and thus Article 21.</li>
                                <li>The procedure under Section 314 of the BMC Act (allowing removal of encroachments without notice) is arbitrary and violates natural justice, thus not being a "fair, just, and reasonable" procedure as required by Article 21 post-<em>Maneka Gandhi</em>.</li>
                                <li>The State/BMC should be estopped from evicting them, given past acquiescence or implied permission (like inclusion in electoral rolls, ration cards issued at pavement addresses).</li>

                                <li>Estoppel cannot operate against a statute or prevent the performance of a statutory duty (removing encroachments). Providing housing is a complex policy matter involving resource constraints.</li>

                            <p>SC delivers judgment affirming right to livelihood under Article 21, but upholds validity of Section 314 BMC Act, allowing eviction after procedural fairness.</p>

                </div>

                <p>The Supreme Court delivered a unanimous and highly significant judgment, authored by CJI Chandrachud. The Court definitively held that the <strong>right to livelihood is an integral part of the Right to Life under Article 21</strong>. It reasoned that for the vast majority, the means of livelihood are essential for the bare sustenance of life itself.</p>
                <p>However, the Court did not accept that pavement dwellers had an absolute right to encroach on public spaces. It upheld the constitutional validity of Section 314 of the BMC Act, stating that the procedure (summary eviction for obstructions) was not per se unreasonable, given the need to keep public ways clear. Crucially, though, the Court read principles of natural justice into the application of the section, implying that notice or hearing should generally be given unless impractical. The Court rejected the argument of promissory estoppel against the BMC but emphasized the State's duty towards the poor based on Directive Principles. While ultimately allowing the eviction, the Court directed that it be carried out humanely, particularly after the monsoon season, and urged the state to provide alternative sites where possible.</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>The Court's analysis beautifully balanced the expanded scope of Article 21 post-<em>Maneka Gandhi</em> with the practical realities of urban governance and property law. By explicitly linking livelihood to life, it gave constitutional weight to the economic struggles of the poor. Its interpretation of Section 314 demonstrated judicial creativity in reading procedural fairness into a seemingly harsh statutory provision, thus upholding the law while mitigating its potentially unjust application. While rejecting estoppel against the statute, the Court used the opportunity to remind the State of its obligations under Directive Principles (like Article 39(a) - adequate means of livelihood, and Article 41 - right to work). The judgment is a classic example of judicial activism tempered with pragmatism, affirming rights while acknowledging legal and administrative constraints.</p>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>FINAL VERDICT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Right to Livelihood is an essential component of the Right to Life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.</li>
                        <li>Section 314 of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, 1888, authorizing the removal of encroachments without notice, is not per se unconstitutional, but must be applied in a fair and reasonable manner.</li>
                        <li>Principles of natural justice (audi alteram partem) should generally be followed before eviction under Section 314, unless giving notice is impractical.</li>
                        <li>The doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked to permit citizens to live on pavements or public property against statutory provisions.</li>
                        <li>The eviction of pavement dwellers was permitted but directed to be carried out humanely, after the monsoon, with efforts towards providing alternative pitches where feasible.</li>
                        <li>The Writ Petitions were partly allowed to the extent of affirming the right to livelihood and reading procedural safeguards into the Act.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>The Right to Life under Article 21 includes the Right to Livelihood because no person can live without the means of living, that is, the means of livelihood. Deprivation of livelihood, except according to a just, fair, and reasonable procedure established by law, can tantamount to deprivation of life. Even where a statute (like Section 314 BMC Act) seemingly permits summary action, principles of natural justice must be read into it unless explicitly and reasonably excluded, especially when fundamental rights like livelihood are affected.</p>
