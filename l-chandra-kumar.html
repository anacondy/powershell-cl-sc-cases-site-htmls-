                <p>This case was referred to a 7-judge bench to resolve conflicting decisions (like <em>S.P. Sampath Kumar</em>) regarding the system of tribunals created by the 42nd Amendment (Articles 323A and 323B) and the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985. These articles allowed Parliament to create tribunals for specific disputes (e.g., service matters, taxes) and, crucially, to <strong>exclude the jurisdiction</strong> of all courts, including the High Courts under Article 226, over these matters.</p>
                <p>The central question was whether these "exclusion clauses" (specifically Article 323A(2)(d) and 323B(3)(d)) were unconstitutional because they took away the power of judicial review from the High Courts, a power the petitioners argued was part of the Basic Structure of the Constitution.</p>

                                <li>The power of judicial review by the High Courts (Article 226) and the Supreme Court (Article 32) is a fundamental aspect of the Constitution's <strong>Basic Structure</strong> (as held in <em>Kesavananda Bharati</em>).</li>
                                <li>Articles 323A(2)(d) and 323B(3)(d), by explicitly allowing Parliament to oust the jurisdiction of High Courts, violate this Basic Structure.</li>
                                <li>Tribunals, often staffed by executive-appointed members, cannot be considered effective substitutes for High Courts for the purpose of judicial review of administrative action.</li>
                                <li>The decision in <em>S.P. Sampath Kumar</em>, which upheld tribunals as substitutes, was incorrect and needed reconsideration.</li>

                            <p>The 7-judge bench unanimously declares judicial review by HCs (Art 226/227) and SC (Art 32) to be part of the Basic Structure, striking down the exclusion clauses.</p>

                <p>The Supreme Court, in a unanimous 7-judge decision, delivered a powerful judgment reaffirming the judiciary's central role. The Court held that the power of <strong>judicial review</strong> vested in the High Courts under Articles 226 and 227, and in the Supreme Court under Article 32, is an <strong>integral and essential feature of the Constitution, forming part of its Basic Structure</strong>.</p>
                <p>Consequently, the "exclusion of jurisdiction" clauses in Articles 323A(2)(d) and 323B(3)(d) were declared <strong>unconstitutional</strong>. The Court ruled that tribunals could not <em>oust</em> the jurisdiction of the High Courts. Instead, tribunals would act as subordinate bodies, and their decisions would be subject to scrutiny (judicial review) by a Division Bench of the High Court under whose jurisdiction they fall, before a party could approach the Supreme Court. The Court overruled its prior decision in <em>S.P. Sampath Kumar</em> to the extent it held that tribunals could be a complete substitute for High Courts.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>Chief Justice Ahmadi's judgment meticulously traced the history of judicial review and its importance as a safeguard against arbitrary state action, linking it to the Basic Structure doctrine from <em>Kesavananda Bharati</em>. The Court reasoned that while tribunals could provide specialized and speedy justice (acting as courts of first instance), they could not replace the constitutional supervisory role of the High Courts (Article 226/227) or the role of the Supreme Court as the ultimate guarantor of fundamental rights (Article 32). By striking down the ouster clauses, the Court preserved the High Courts' power as vital pillars of the judicial system. It created a new, streamlined hierarchy: a decision by a tribunal could be challenged directly before a Division Bench of the relevant High Court, thus maintaining the system of judicial review while still utilizing the specialized tribunals.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The power of judicial review vested in the High Courts under Articles 226/227 and the Supreme Court under Article 32 is a <strong>Basic Feature</strong> of the Constitution.</li>
                        <li>Clause 2(d) of Article 323A and Clause 3(d) of Article 323B, which permitted the exclusion of the High Courts' jurisdiction, are <strong>unconstitutional and void</strong>.</li>
                        <li>All tribunals created under Articles 323A and 323B shall function as <strong>subordinate</strong> to the High Courts.</li>
                        <li>Decisions of these tribunals will be subject to judicial review by a <strong>Division Bench</strong> of the High Court within whose jurisdiction the tribunal falls.</li>
                        <li>The <em>S.P. Sampath Kumar v. Union of India</em> (1987) decision was overruled to the extent that it contradicted these findings.</li>

                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>The power of judicial review over legislative and administrative action, vested in the High Courts under Articles 226 and 227 and in the Supreme Court under Article 32, is an integral and essential feature of the Constitution, constituting part of its <strong>basic structure</strong>. Therefore, the "exclusion of jurisdiction" clauses in Articles 323A(2)(d) and 323B(3)(d) are unconstitutional. Tribunals created under these articles will act as courts of first instance, and their decisions will be subject to the writ jurisdiction of the High Courts under Articles 226/227.</p>
