                <p>This case primarily challenged the validity of the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964. This amendment expanded the definition of "estate" under Article 31A and added several more land reform acts (including Rajasthan's) to the Ninth Schedule, protecting them from judicial review based on fundamental rights violations.</p>
                <p>The core issue revisited was whether Parliament's power to amend the Constitution under Article 368 extended to amending Fundamental Rights, essentially asking the court to reconsider its decision in *Shankari Prasad*. The petitioners argued that the amendment affected rights under Articles 14, 19, and 31.</p>

                            <h4>Supreme Court Judgment</h4>
                            <p>By a 3:2 majority, the Court upholds the 17th Amendment and reaffirms *Shankari Prasad*, though two judges express doubts.</p>
                            <span class="date">October 30, 1964</span>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>The majority (CJI Gajendragadkar, Wanchoo, Shah JJ.) upheld the decision in *Shankari Prasad*. They reaffirmed that the power under Article 368 was distinct from legislative power and that a constitutional amendment was not "law" under Article 13(2). Thus, Parliament could amend Fundamental Rights.</p>
                <p>However, Justices Hidayatullah and Mudholkar, while concurring with the final order (upholding the amendment), expressed significant doubts about the correctness of *Shankari Prasad*. Justice Hidayatullah questioned whether Fundamental Rights, being so essential, could be amended easily. Justice Mudholkar, significantly, questioned whether there were *basic features* of the Constitution that Parliament could not amend, planting the seeds for the future Basic Structure Doctrine.</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>The majority largely followed the reasoning of *Shankari Prasad*, emphasizing the distinction between constituent and legislative power. CJI Gajendragadkar argued that if the framers intended to make Fundamental Rights unamendable, they would have stated so explicitly. The key development, however, came from the concurring opinions. Justice Hidayatullah expressed unease about the potential scope of amendment power over fundamental freedoms. Justice Mudholkar went further, citing precedents from other countries and questioning if certain fundamental characteristics of the Constitution were beyond the reach of Article 368, hinting at an implied limitation on the amending power – a precursor to the Basic Structure Doctrine.</p>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>FINAL VERDICT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964, was held to be valid.</li>
                        <li>The decision in *Shankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India* was upheld by the majority.</li>
                        <li>Parliament possesses the power under Article 368 to amend Fundamental Rights.</li>
                        <li>The writ petitions were dismissed.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>(Majority View): Parliament's power under Article 368 includes the power to amend Fundamental Rights, as a constitutional amendment is an exercise of constituent power, not ordinary legislative power limited by Article 13(2).</p>
                    <p>(Minority Concurring View - Hidayatullah & Mudholkar JJ.): While concurring in the result, expressed doubts about the unlimited nature of the amending power concerning Fundamental Rights and raised the possibility of certain 'basic features' being unamendable.</p>
                    <p>*(Note: The majority view reaffirming Shankari Prasad was soon overturned in I.C. Golaknath (1967). The minority view's doubts became crucial in Kesavananda Bharati (1973).)*</p>
