                <p>This landmark case challenged the legality of the "Communal Government Order" (G.O.) issued by the Madras government, which fixed quotas for admission to state medical and engineering colleges based on caste and religion. Smt. Champakam Dorairajan, a Brahmin candidate denied admission despite higher marks, argued this violated her fundamental rights.</p>
                <p>The Supreme Court unanimously struck down the Communal G.O. as unconstitutional. It held that reservations based solely on caste or religion violated the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 15(1) (non-discrimination) and Article 29(2) (non-denial of admission based on religion, race, caste, language).</p>

                            <h4>First Constitutional Amendment</h4>
                            <p>In direct response to this judgment, Parliament passes the First Amendment, adding Article 15(4) to permit special provisions for backward classes.</p>

                <p>The Court clearly established the primacy of Fundamental Rights over Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) in case of a conflict. It stated that while DPSPs are fundamental in the governance of the country (Article 37), they are not legally enforceable, unlike Fundamental Rights.</p>
                <p>This judgment had immediate and profound consequences, leading directly to the First Amendment to the Constitution of India in 1951. Parliament added clause (4) to Article 15, explicitly allowing the state to make special provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes, thereby creating the constitutional basis for reservations.</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>The Court's analysis focused on the direct conflict between the non-discrimination clauses (Articles 15(1) and 29(2)) and the state's attempt to implement a Directive Principle (Article 46). Justice S.R. Das, writing for the unanimous bench, emphasized the mandatory and enforceable nature of Fundamental Rights. He stated that the Directive Principles, while important guidelines, could not override the specific prohibitions laid down in Part III (Fundamental Rights). The Court interpreted Article 29(2) broadly, holding that denial of admission *solely* on grounds of religion, race, caste, etc., was impermissible in any state-maintained or state-aided educational institution. The argument for harmonious construction failed because the G.O. created a direct violation of the fundamental right against discrimination.</p>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>FINAL VERDICT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The appeal by the State of Madras was dismissed.</li>
                        <li>The Communal Government Order (G.O.) allocating seats in state colleges based on caste and religion was declared void and unconstitutional.</li>
                        <li>The G.O. was held to be in violation of Articles 15(1) and 29(2) of the Constitution.</li>
                        <li>Fundamental Rights were held to prevail over Directive Principles in case of irreconcilable conflict.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution are justiciable and enforceable, whereas Directive Principles of State Policy under Part IV are not. In case of a direct conflict between a Fundamental Right and a Directive Principle, the Fundamental Right shall prevail. Classification for admission to state educational institutions based solely on religion, race, or caste violates Articles 15(1) and 29(2).</p>
                    <p>*(Note: The effect of this ratio regarding reservations was modified by the subsequent First Amendment adding Article 15(4).)*</p>
