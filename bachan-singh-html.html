                <p>This landmark case addressed the constitutional validity of the death penalty for murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Bachan Singh, convicted of murder and sentenced to death, challenged the sentence, arguing that capital punishment violated Fundamental Rights under Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution.</p>
                <p>The case specifically examined the effect of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, particularly Section 354(3), which mandated that judges provide "special reasons" for imposing the death sentence, implying life imprisonment was now the norm. The Court had to determine if this provision provided sufficient guidelines to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory application of the death penalty.</p>

                                <li>Section 302 IPC, read with Section 354(3) CrPC, lacks clear legislative guidelines for choosing between life imprisonment and death, leading to arbitrary and unequal application, violating Article 14.</li>
                                <li>The death penalty serves no proven deterrent purpose beyond life imprisonment.</li>

                            <h4>Supreme Court Judgment (Bachan Singh)</h4>
                            <p>By a 4:1 majority, SC upholds the validity of the death penalty but lays down the "rarest of rare" doctrine based on Section 354(3) CrPC.</p>
                            <span class="date">May 9, 1980</span>
                        </div>

                </div>

                <p>The Supreme Court, by a 4:1 majority, upheld the constitutional validity of the death penalty provided under Section 302 of the IPC. The Court held that capital punishment did not violate Articles 14, 19, or 21 of the Constitution.</p>
                <p>Crucially, the majority interpreted Section 354(3) of the CrPC, which requires "special reasons" for imposing death, as a significant safeguard. This provision meant that life imprisonment became the default sentence for murder, and the death penalty was to be imposed only exceptionally. To guide this exception, the Court formulated the famous <strong>"rarest of rare cases"</strong> doctrine. This required courts to consider both aggravating and mitigating circumstances (relating to the crime and the criminal) and to impose death only when the alternative of life imprisonment was "unquestionably foreclosed." Justice P.N. Bhagwati dissented strongly, arguing that the death penalty was inherently arbitrary and violated Articles 14 and 21.</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>Justice Sarkaria, writing for the majority, acknowledged the expanded scope of Article 21 post-<em>Maneka Gandhi</em> but concluded that the Constitution implicitly permitted the death penalty. The analysis focused heavily on Section 354(3) CrPC as the legislative attempt to structure sentencing discretion. The "rarest of rare" doctrine was derived from this statutory provision, aiming to ensure that the death penalty was not applied arbitrarily. The Court emphasized the need for a balance between aggravating factors (like the brutality of the crime) and mitigating factors (like the age, background, and potential for reformation of the accused). The majority found that this framework, requiring a reasoned sentencing decision focused on exception, sufficiently addressed the concerns of arbitrariness under Article 14. Justice Bhagwati's dissent, however, maintained that judicial discretion, even within the "rarest of rare" framework, remained inherently subjective and prone to error, making the death penalty constitutionally unacceptable due to its finality and potential for arbitrariness.</p>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>FINAL VERDICT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The constitutional validity of the death penalty for murder under Section 302 IPC, read with Section 354(3) CrPC, was upheld.</li>
                        <li>The death penalty does not violate Articles 14, 19, or 21 of the Constitution.</li>
                        <li>Section 354(3) CrPC marks a shift where life imprisonment is the rule and death penalty is an exception, requiring "special reasons".</li>
                        <li>The "rarest of rare cases" doctrine was established: death penalty should only be imposed when life imprisonment is unquestionably foreclosed, after considering aggravating and mitigating circumstances.</li>
                        <li>The appeal/petition challenging the sentence was dismissed based on the application of these principles to the facts of the case.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>The provision of death penalty as an alternative punishment for murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code is not unconstitutional; it does not violate the guarantees under Articles 14, 19, and 21. However, guided by Section 354(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the death sentence ought not to be imposed save in the <strong>"rarest of rare cases"</strong> where the alternative option is unquestionably foreclosed. Sentencing requires a balancing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances relating to both the crime and the offender.</p>
