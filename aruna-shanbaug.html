                <p>This petition was filed by journalist Pinki Virani, acting as the "next friend" of Aruna Shanbaug. Aruna Shanbaug was a nurse at KEM Hospital, Mumbai, who was brutally sexually assaulted by a ward boy in 1973, leaving her in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) for 37 years. She was cared for by the nurses at KEM Hospital during this entire period.</p>
                <p>The petitioner argued that Aruna's continued existence was not life, but a state of "unbearable agony" and that she should be allowed to die with dignity. The petition sought <strong>passive euthanasia</strong>: the withdrawal of food and water (via her feeding tube), which was keeping her alive.</p>

                                <li>Her "life" is devoid of any human dignity, violating Article 21.</li>
                                <li>She has a right to die with dignity, which is implicit in the right to life.</li>
                                <li>As Aruna cannot consent, the Court should grant permission for passive euthanasia (withdrawing food/water) as her "next friend".</li>

                </div>

                <p>The Supreme Court delivered a historic and compassionate judgment. While it <strong>dismissed the petition</strong> to allow passive euthanasia for Aruna Shanbaug (primarily because the KEM staff who cared for her opposed it and the medical panel found she was not brain dead), the Court used the opportunity to lay down the law for the entire country.</p>
                <p>The Court held that the <strong>Right to Die with Dignity</strong> is a part of the Right to Life under Article 21. It <strong>legalized passive euthanasia</strong> (withdrawing life support from patients in a PVS) but held that <strong>active euthanasia</strong> (lethal injection) remains illegal. To prevent misuse, the Court created a strict procedural safeguard: passive euthanasia would only be permissible after a High Court (acting under Article 226) approves the request, based on the findings of a medical board. This judgment filled a legal vacuum, providing a path for families in similar situations.</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>The Court (in Justice Katju's opinion) distinguished itself from the <em>Gian Kaur</em> case (which held 'right to die' is not part of 'right to life') by focusing on the "right to die <em>with dignity</em>" for those in an irreversible coma or PVS. The analysis heavily relied on international jurisprudence, particularly the UK's <em>Airedale</em> case, which permitted withdrawing life support from a PVS patient. The Court's primary concern was creating a safeguard against misuse, as seen in countries like the Netherlands. It designated the High Courts, rather than individuals or families alone, as the arbiters to ensure the decision is made objectively and based on expert medical opinion, thus balancing individual dignity with the state's interest in protecting life.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>FINAL VERDICT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The petition to withdraw life support for Aruna Shanbaug was <strong>dismissed</strong>, primarily respecting the wishes of the KEM Hospital staff who cared for her.</li>
                        <li><strong>Passive Euthanasia</strong> (withdrawing life support/food) was declared <strong>legal</strong> in India for patients in a permanent vegetative state (PVS).</li>
                        <li><strong>Active Euthanasia</strong> (lethal injection, etc.) remains <strong>illegal</strong> and a crime under the IPC.</li>
                        <li>The Right to Life under Article 21 includes the <strong>Right to Die with Dignity</strong>.</li>
                        <li>The Court laid down <strong>binding guidelines</strong> for passive euthanasia: it requires a petition to the <strong>High Court</strong>, which must appoint a medical board and hear all parties before deciding.</li>
                        <li>These guidelines are to be followed until Parliament enacts a law on the subject.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>The Right to Life guaranteed by Article 21 includes the right to live with human dignity, and in the case of a terminally ill person or someone in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) with no hope of recovery, this right extends to a <strong>Right to Die with Dignity</strong>. Passive euthanasia (the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment or food) is permissible in such cases to end prolonged suffering, but only under strict procedural safeguards regulated by the High Court to prevent misuse.</p>
                    <p><em>(Note: The law on passive euthanasia was further clarified and solidified in the Common Cause v. Union of India (2018) judgment, which legalized 'living wills'.)</em></p>
