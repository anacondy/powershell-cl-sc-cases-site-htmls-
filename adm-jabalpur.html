                <p>Popularly known as the <strong>Habeas Corpus Case</strong>, this is widely regarded as one of the most controversial and darkest judgments in the history of the Indian Supreme Court. The case was decided during the Emergency imposed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1975.</p>
                <p>The central question was whether a writ of habeas corpus, challenging the grounds of detention, could be maintained in a High Court while a Presidential Order under Article 359(1) of the Constitution was in force, suspending the right to move any court for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights under Articles 14, 21, and 22.</p>

                    <h4>Petitioner's Case (State - ADM Jabalpur)</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The Presidential Order under Article 359(1) is absolute. It suspends the very <em>locus standi</em> (right to approach the court) of any person to seek enforcement of the specified Fundamental Rights.</li>
                        <li>Article 21 is the sole repository of the right to life and personal liberty. Once its enforcement is suspended, no remedy exists to challenge a detention, even if it is arbitrary or mala fide.</li>
                        <li>The right to personal liberty is a gift of the Constitution and does not exist as a common law or natural law right outside of Article 21.</li>
                        <li>The intent of the framers during an Emergency was to grant the executive wide, unchallengeable powers to protect national security, subordinating individual liberty to state interests.</li>

                    <h4>Respondent's Case (Detenus - Shivkant Shukla & others)</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The suspension of the <em>remedy</em> under Article 32 or 226 does not suspend the <em>right</em> itself. The right to life and personal liberty pre-dates the Constitution and exists as a natural and common law right.</li>
                        <li>A detention order must still comply with the parent statute (Maintenance of Internal Security Act - MISA). The writ of habeas corpus can be issued if the detention is ultra vires the Act, mala fide, based on extraneous considerations, or ordered by an unauthorized officer.</li>
                        <li>The rule of law is a basic feature of the Constitution. Even during an Emergency, the executive is not above the law and must act within the authority conferred by statute.</li>
                        <li>The suspension of Article 21 cannot bar a challenge to detention if the order is not "under the Act" at all.</li>

                        <h4>Judgment Overruled</h4>
                        <p>In <em>Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. UOI (2017)</em>, the Supreme Court formally overrules the majority decision in ADM Jabalpur, calling it a grave error.</p>
                        <span class="date">August 24, 2017</span>

            <p>The Supreme Court, by a 4:1 majority, held that in view of the Presidential Order dated June 27, 1975, no person has any <em>locus standi</em> to move any writ petition under Article 226 before a High Court for habeas corpus or any other writ to challenge the legality of a detention order on the ground that the order is not under or in compliance with the Act (MISA) or is illegal or is vitiated by malafides.</p>
            <p>The majority opinion effectively stated that during the Emergency, the right to life and personal liberty was at the mercy of the executive, and courts were powerless to intervene, even if the executive's actions were arbitrary or unlawful.</p>

            <div class="analysis-section">
                <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                <p>The majority opinion, delivered by CJI Ray and Justices Beg, Chandrachud, and Bhagwati, adopted a highly positivist and textualist approach. They reasoned that since Article 21 was the "sole repository" of the right to personal liberty, its suspension left no other legal basis (like natural law or common law) to challenge a deprivation of liberty. The court gave immense deference to the state's arguments about national security, effectively creating a legal vacuum where the executive was not accountable to the judiciary for matters of personal liberty.</p>
                <p>In a powerful and solitary dissent, Justice H.R. Khanna argued that Article 21 is not the sole repository of the right to life and liberty. This right is a basic human right that exists independent of the Constitution. He contended that the state cannot deprive a person of life or liberty without the authority of law, and the courts could always examine whether the executive action was supported by a valid law. He famously wrote: <em>"The suspension of the right to move any court for the enforcement of the right under Article 21 cannot have the effect of debarring a person from approaching the court for a remedy against a report of injury to his person if it is caused by a private individual. The same must be the position in case of a report of injury to the person of an individual by a public official if the act is not supported by any valid law."</em> His dissent cost him the position of Chief Justice of India but is now celebrated as a courageous defense of liberty and the rule of law.</p>

                <h4>FINAL VERDICT</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The writ of habeas corpus is not maintainable in any High Court to challenge the legality of a detention order during the Emergency.</li>
                    <li>The suspension of the remedy under Article 359(1) for the enforcement of Article 21 bars any challenge to deprivation of life or personal liberty.</li>
                    <li>Article 21 is the sole repository of the right to life and personal liberty.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dissent (Khanna, J.):</strong> The right to life and liberty is a pre-constitutional, basic human right. A person can still approach the court to challenge a detention if it is not authorized by law.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="small-font-section">
                <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                <p>During the operation of a Presidential Order under Article 359(1) suspending the enforcement of Fundamental Rights, a person's <em>locus standi</em> to approach a court for a writ of habeas corpus to challenge a detention is completely barred, as Article 21 is the sole source of the right to personal liberty in Indian law.</p>
                <p><em>(Note: This ratio was explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India in 2017.)</em></p>
