                <p>This petition challenged the constitutional validity of Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the criminal law on adultery. This 158-year-old law made it a crime for a man to have sexual intercourse with the wife of another man, without the husband's consent or connivance. The law was widely criticized as being archaic and discriminatory.</p>
                <p>The petitioners argued that Section 497 was blatantly discriminatory. It only punished the man, not the woman (who was treated as an abettor), and effectively treated the wife as the "property" of her husband, whose consent was all that mattered. It also denied women the right to prosecute their adulterous husbands. This, they argued, violated Articles 14 (Equality), 15 (Non-discrimination), and 21 (Dignity and Personal Autonomy).</p>

                                <li>The law is archaic and based on Victorian-era morality that no longer applies.</li>

                            <p>The 5-judge bench unanimously strikes down Section 497 IPC and Section 198(2) CrPC as unconstitutional.</p>

                </div>

                <p>In a unanimous 5-0 judgment, the Supreme Court **struck down Section 497 of the IPC as unconstitutional**. The Court held that the law was archaic, discriminatory, and violated the fundamental rights of women.</p>
                <p>The judges, in four concurring opinions, found that Section 497 was "manifestly arbitrary" and violated Article 14 (Equality) because it treated women as the property of their husbands, giving the husband sole right to prosecute the adulterer. It also violated Article 15(1) as it was based on gender stereotypes. Crucially, the Court held that the law infringed upon the **dignity, privacy, and sexual autonomy** of women under Article 21, by denying them the right to make independent choices about their sexuality. The Court **overruled** its previous judgments in <em>Yusuf Abdul Aziz</em>, <em>Sowmithri Vishnu</em>, and <em>V. Revathi</em>. Section 198(2) of the CrPC was also struck down. The Court clarified that adultery would remain a valid ground for civil remedies like divorce.</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>The judgment was a powerful assertion of individual autonomy and gender equality. CJI Misra's opinion stated that any law that treats a woman with inequality is unconstitutional and that the "husband is not the master of the wife." Justice Nariman found the law to be an "archaic" provision. Justice Chandrachud's opinion was notable for its focus on sexual autonomy as a part of dignity under Article 21, stating that Section 497 "denies to a woman the right to sexual autonomy" and "perpetuates the notion that a woman is her husband's chattel." Justice Indu Malhotra pointed out that the law was based on the paternalistic assumption that a woman is a victim with no independent agency. The judgment collectively dismantled the law's foundation, which was rooted in Victorian morality and the concept of women as property rather than equal partners in a marriage.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, is declared **unconstitutional** and void.</li>
                        <li>Section 198(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, which gave the husband exclusive right to prosecute, is also declared unconstitutional.</li>
                        <li>The law on adultery was found to be **manifestly arbitrary** and in violation of Article 14 (Equality).</li>
                        <li>It was held to be discriminatory on the basis of gender, violating Article 15(1).</li>
                        <li>It was held to violate the Right to Life with Dignity, Privacy, and Autonomy under Article 21.</li>
                        <li>The judgment **overruled** previous precedents including <em>Yusuf Abdul Aziz</em>, <em>Sowmithri Vishnu</em>, and <em>V. Revathi</em>.</li>
                        <li>It was clarified that adultery remains a valid **ground for civil divorce**.</li>

                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>A law that criminalizes adultery in a manner that treats women as the property of their husbands, punishes only the male partner, and denies women agency and sexual autonomy, is manifestly arbitrary and violates the constitutional principles of equality (Article 14), non-discrimination (Article 15), and the right to life with dignity and personal autonomy (Article 21). The husband cannot be considered the "master" of his wife, and legal sovereignty of one sex over the other is unconstitutional.</p>
