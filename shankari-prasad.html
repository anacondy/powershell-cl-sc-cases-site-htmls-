                <p>This case was the first major challenge to Parliament's power to amend the Constitution, specifically concerning Fundamental Rights. The petitioners, Zamindars affected by land reform laws, challenged the validity of the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951.</p>
                <p>The First Amendment had introduced Articles 31A and 31B and the Ninth Schedule to protect land reform laws (like the Bihar Land Reforms Act) from being challenged on the grounds that they violated Fundamental Rights (particularly the right to property, then under Article 19(1)(f) and Article 31). The petitioners argued that this amendment itself violated Article 13(2), which stated that the State shall not make any "law" taking away or abridging Fundamental Rights.</p>

                <p>The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the petitioners' arguments. It held that Parliament's power to amend the Constitution under Article 368 was a constituent power, different from its ordinary legislative power.</p>
                <p>Therefore, a constitutional amendment was not a "law" as meant by Article 13(2), and Parliament *could* amend Fundamental Rights. The First Amendment Act, 1951, was thus held to be valid.</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>Justice Patanjali Sastri, delivering the unanimous judgment, focused on the distinction between legislative power (making ordinary laws) and constituent power (amending the constitution). The Court reasoned that Article 13(2)'s prohibition against laws abridging fundamental rights applied only to ordinary legislation, not to amendments made under the specific process outlined in Article 368. It held that Article 368 contained both the power and the procedure for amendment, and this power was plenary (complete) and included the ability to amend any part of the Constitution, including Part III (Fundamental Rights). The Court interpreted the word "law" in Article 13(2) narrowly to exclude constitutional amendments.</p>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>FINAL VERDICT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, was held to be valid.</li>
                        <li>Parliament has the power under Article 368 to amend any part of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights in Part III.</li>
                        <li>A constitutional amendment passed under Article 368 is not considered a "law" within the meaning of Article 13(2).</li>
                        <li>The writ petitions challenging the First Amendment were dismissed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>The power to amend the Constitution conferred upon Parliament under Article 368 is a constituent power, distinct from ordinary legislative power. The term "law" in Article 13(2) encompasses only ordinary laws enacted by legislatures and does not include constitutional amendments made in the exercise of constituent power. Therefore, Fundamental Rights are not immune from constitutional amendment under Article 368.</p>
                    <p>*(Note: This position was later affirmed in Sajjan Singh (1965) but overruled in I.C. Golaknath (1967), before being partially restored with limitations by the Basic Structure Doctrine in Kesavananda Bharati (1973).)*</p>
