                <p>This landmark case was initiated by Shayara Bano, a woman who was divorced by her husband of 15 years through instant triple talaq (<em>Talaq-e-Biddat</em>) via a letter. The petition, along with others from women's rights groups, challenged the constitutionality of <em>Talaq-e-Biddat</em>, polygamy, and <em>nikah halala</em> (the practice where a divorced woman must marry another man and consummate the marriage before she can remarry her first husband).</p>
                <p>A 5-judge multi-faith bench (comprising judges from Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Zoroastrian, and Muslim faiths) was constituted to hear the case, focusing primarily on the validity of <em>Talaq-e-Biddat</em>. The case centered on whether this practice was protected by the right to religion (Article 25) or if it violated fundamental rights to equality (Article 14), non-discrimination (Article 15), and life with dignity (Article 21).</p>

                                <li>Instant triple talaq is arbitrary, whimsical, and violates a woman's right to equality under Article 14, as it gives men a unilateral right to divorce without any cause or procedure.</li>
                                <li>The practice is discriminatory on the basis of gender, violating Article 15.</li>
                                <li>It violates the right to life with dignity under Article 21.</li>
                                <li><em>Talaq-e-Biddat</em> is not an essential religious practice in Islam; many Islamic scholars and countries have banned or reformed it. Therefore, it is not protected by Article 25.</li>
                                <li>Personal laws should be subject to fundamental rights.</li>

                                <li>Article 25 protects the right to practice one's religion, and for Sunni Muslims of the Hanafi school, triple talaq is an established (though sinful) part of their personal law.</li>
                                <li>The <em>Shariat Act, 1937</em>, recognizes personal law, giving it statutory protection.</li>
                                <li>Reform should come from within the community or through legislation, not judicial invalidation.</li>

                            <p>Parliament passes a law criminalizing the practice of instant triple talaq, making it a punishable offense.</p>

                <p>In a historic 3:2 split decision, the Supreme Court <strong>set aside the practice of <em>Talaq-e-Biddat</em> (instant triple talaq)</strong> as unconstitutional. The majority, however, was formed on different grounds.</p>
                <p>Justices R.F. Nariman and U.U. Lalit held that <em>Talaq-e-Biddat</em> was regulated by the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, and was thus "law" under Article 13. They found the practice to be <strong>"manifestly arbitrary"</strong> because it allowed a husband to end a marriage whimsically and instantaneously, without any attempt at reconciliation. Therefore, it violated Article 14 (Right to Equality). Justice K.M. Joseph, in his concurring opinion, held that triple talaq was <strong>not an essential religious practice</strong> in Islam as it was not sanctioned by the Holy Quran. He argued that what is bad in theology cannot be good in law, and thus it could not be protected under Article 25. The dissenting minority (CJI Khehar and Justice Nazeer) held that personal law was not subject to Fundamental Rights and that the practice, while sinful, was protected by Article 25, urging Parliament to legislate on the matter.</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>The majority judgments, though reaching the same conclusion via different routes, were a significant step in constitutional law and gender justice. The Nariman/Lalit opinion innovatively used the "manifest arbitrariness" test (under Article 14) to strike down a provision of personal law that had been given statutory recognition. This provided a powerful tool to challenge arbitrary state action (or state-sanctioned action) without getting into the complex debate of whether personal law <em>itself</em> is "law" under Article 13. Justice Joseph's analysis, conversely, delved into theology to determine that the practice was not "essential" to Islam, thus stripping it of Article 25's protection. The combined effect was the invalidation of a centuries-old practice deemed discriminatory against women, paving the way for subsequent parliamentary legislation criminalizing it.</p>

                    <h4>FINAL VERDICT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The practice of <em>Talaq-e-Biddat</em> (instant triple talaq) was declared <strong>unconstitutional</strong> and set aside by a 3:2 majority.</li>
                        <li>(Majority - Nariman & Lalit JJ): The practice is manifestly arbitrary and violates Article 14 (Equality).</li>
                        <li>(Majority - Joseph J): The practice is not an essential part of the Islamic religion and is therefore not protected by Article 25.</li>
                        <li>(Dissent - Khehar CJI & Nazeer J): The practice is part of personal law, protected by Article 25, and cannot be struck down by the judiciary; it is for Parliament to regulate.</li>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>(Per Nariman and Lalit, JJ.): The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, in so far as it recognizes and enforces <em>Talaq-e-Biddat</em>, is a "law in force" under Article 13(1). This practice, being manifestly arbitrary in that it allows a husband to whimsically and capriciously divorce his wife, is violative of Article 14 (Equality before Law).</p>
                    <p>(Per Joseph, J.): <em>Talaq-e-Biddat</em> is held to be bad in theology (not sanctioned by the Quran) and therefore cannot be considered an essential religious practice. What is bad in theology cannot be good in law, and thus cannot be protected under Article 25.</p>
