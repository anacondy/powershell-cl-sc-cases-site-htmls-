                <p>This landmark PIL challenged the constitutional validity of <strong>Section 8(4)</strong> of the Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1951. This controversial provision acted as a "saving clause" for sitting Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of Legislative Assemblies (MLAs). While Sections 8(1), (2), and (3) disqualified any person convicted of certain crimes (and sentenced to 2+ years) from contesting elections, Section 8(4) allowed a convicted <em>sitting</em> legislator to remain in office and contest elections, provided they filed an appeal against their conviction within three months, until that appeal was disposed of.</p>
                <p>The petitioners argued that this provision was discriminatory, arbitrary, and violated the Constitution by creating an unequal class of citizens (legislators vs. non-legislators) and by allowing convicted criminals to continue making laws, which is against the principles of democracy and rule of law.</p>

                                <li>Articles 102(1)(e) and 191(1)(e) state a person is disqualified if disqualified by any law made by Parliament. Section 8(3) <em>is</em> that law.</li>
                                <li>Section 8(4) creates an unreasonable classification between sitting legislators and other citizens, violating the equality guarantee of Article 14.</li>
                                <li>Parliament has the power to <em>make</em> a law setting disqualifications, but it does <em>not</em> have the power to create an exception for its own members from that very disqualification.</li>
                                <li>Allowing convicted criminals to remain legislators pollutes the political process and is against constitutional morality.</li>

                                <li>An appeal is a continuation of the trial, and the conviction is not final until the appeal is decided. Thus, disqualification should not be immediate.</li>

                <p>The Supreme Court delivered a unanimous and resounding judgment, declaring <strong>Section 8(4) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, to be unconstitutional</strong> and therefore void. The Court held that Parliament had no legislative power to create such an exception for sitting legislators.</p>
                <p>The Court ruled that the disqualification under Articles 102(1)(e) and 191(1)(e) is <strong>instantaneous</strong> upon conviction (for the specified offences/duration). Section 8(4), by allowing a convicted legislator to continue in office, directly contradicted the constitutional mandate. The judgment meant that any MP, MLA, or MLC convicted of a crime with a sentence of two years or more would be <strong>immediately disqualified</strong> from their seat, regardless of whether they filed an appeal (unless the conviction itself was stayed by an appellate court).</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>Justice A. K. Patnaik, writing for the bench, focused on the text of the Constitution. Articles 102(1)(e) and 191(1)(e) clearly state that a person <em>is</em> disqualified if they are "so disqualified by or under any law made by Parliament." Sections 8(1), (2), and (3) <em>are</em> that law. Parliament, having made the law causing disqualification, cannot then create a separate law (Section 8(4)) to exempt a specific group (itself) from that disqualification. The Court held this to be beyond Parliament's legislative competence and a violation of Article 14's equality principle, as it created two classes of convicted criminals—regular citizens who are disqualified, and sitting legislators who are not. This judgment was a major step in electoral reform, aimed at decriminalizing politics.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>FINAL VERDICT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Section 8(4) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, is declared <strong>unconstitutional</strong> and void.</li>
                        <li>Parliament has no legislative competence to create a provision that saves sitting legislators from immediate disqualification upon conviction.</li>
                        <li>Disqualification for MPs, MLAs, and MLCs upon conviction (for specified offences/duration) is <strong>automatic and immediate</strong> from the date of conviction.</li>
                        <li>The filing of an appeal or a stay of the <em>sentence</em> is not sufficient to avoid disqualification; only a <strong>stay of the conviction</strong> by an appellate court can reverse the disqualification.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>Parliament's power under Articles 102(1)(e) and 191(1)(e) of the Constitution is to "make a law" setting conditions for disqualification, not to create exceptions for its own members from those very conditions. Section 8(4) of the RPA, by creating a class of sitting legislators exempt from the immediate disqualification applied to other citizens, is discriminatory and violates Article 14. The disqualification takes effect from the date of conviction, not from the date of the appeal's disposal.</p>
