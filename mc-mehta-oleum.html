                <p>This landmark Public Interest Litigation (PIL) arose following a leak of hazardous Oleum gas from a unit of Shriram Foods and Fertiliser Industries in Delhi in December 1985, which caused widespread panic and injury, including the death of an advocate practicing in the Tis Hazari courts. Environmental activist M.C. Mehta filed a writ petition seeking closure of the plant and compensation for the victims.</p>
                <p>The case raised critical questions about the liability of enterprises engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous activities. The Court had to decide whether the traditional rule of Strict Liability (from the English case <em>Rylands v. Fletcher</em>), which allowed for exceptions, was adequate for protecting citizens' rights in an industrialized society, particularly the Right to Life under Article 21.</p>

                                <li>A stricter, absolute standard of liability is needed to ensure safety and compensate victims adequately, especially considering the potential for catastrophic harm.</li>

                <p>The Supreme Court, in a path-breaking judgment delivered by CJI Bhagwati, established the principle of <strong>Absolute Liability</strong> for industries engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous activities. The Court consciously departed from the 19th-century English rule of Strict Liability laid down in <em>Rylands v. Fletcher</em>, deeming it inadequate for modern industrial risks.</p>
                <p>The Court held that an enterprise carrying out hazardous activities, especially if for profit, owes an <strong>absolute and non-delegable duty</strong> to the community to ensure no harm results. If harm does occur, the enterprise is absolutely liable to compensate all affected parties, and this liability is <strong>not subject to any of the exceptions</strong> allowed under the rule of strict liability. The Court linked this principle to the Right to Life under Article 21, emphasizing the need for a safe and healthy environment.</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>CJI Bhagwati's analysis highlighted the need for Indian environmental jurisprudence to evolve independently, tailored to the country's specific conditions. He argued that the old rule of Strict Liability, developed in a pre-industrial era, was insufficient. The Court reasoned that enterprises undertaking hazardous activities have a social obligation; if they profit from such activities, they must bear the cost of any resulting harm, regardless of fault or the presence of traditional exceptions. The principle of <strong>Absolute Liability</strong> was thus crafted as a stronger, indigenous legal standard. The Court also innovatively linked the measure of compensation not just to the harm suffered but also to the magnitude and capacity of the enterprise, ensuring that the compensation acts as a deterrent. This judgment significantly strengthened environmental law and corporate accountability in India.</p>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>FINAL VERDICT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The principle of <strong>Absolute Liability</strong> was established for enterprises engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous activities.</li>
                        <li>Such enterprises owe an absolute and non-delegable duty to the community; if harm results from their activity, they are liable without exceptions (unlike Strict Liability).</li>
                        <li>The rule in <em>Rylands v. Fletcher</em> (Strict Liability) was deemed unsuitable for conditions in India.</li>
                        <li>The measure of compensation must be correlated to the magnitude and capacity of the enterprise to act as a deterrent.</li>
                        <li>This liability arises under both the law of torts and as a violation of the Right to Life (Article 21).</li>
                        <li>(Subsequent orders dealt with the specific directions for plant operation, safety measures, and compensation assessment).</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>Where an enterprise is engaged in a hazardous or inherently dangerous activity and harm results to anyone on account of an accident in the operation of such hazardous activity (e.g., escape of toxic gas), the enterprise is <strong>strictly and absolutely liable</strong> to compensate all those who are affected by the accident. Such liability is not subject to any of the exceptions which operate vis-à-vis the tortious principle of strict liability under the rule in <em>Rylands v. Fletcher</em>. The measure of compensation must be correlated to the magnitude and capacity of the enterprise because such compensation must have a deterrent effect.</p>
