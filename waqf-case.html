                <p>In a significant ruling clarifying the scope of the Waqf Act, 1995, the Supreme Court held that the Waqf Tribunal holds exclusive jurisdiction to decide whether a property is Waqf property or not. This decision overturned a Bombay High Court judgment that had allowed parallel proceedings in a civil court.</p>
                <p>The case involved a dispute over properties claimed by the Maharashtra State Board of Waqfs. The CEO of the Waqf Board had initiated an inquiry under Section 40 of the Act. Respondents challenged this in the High Court, which ruled against the Board. The Supreme Court reviewed the interplay between various sections of the Waqf Act.</p>

                <p>The Supreme Court emphasized that the Waqf Act is a special statute designed to provide a comprehensive mechanism for resolving disputes related to Waqf properties through specialized Tribunals.</p>
                <p>Allowing parallel proceedings in civil courts or High Courts (via writ petitions challenging preliminary steps) would undermine the legislative intent and the efficacy of the Tribunal system established by the Act.</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>The core of the analysis involved interpreting Section 83 (jurisdiction of Tribunal) and Section 85 (bar of jurisdiction of Civil Courts) of the Waqf Act, 1995. The Court referenced precedents establishing that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is wide-ranging, covering any dispute relating to a Waqf or Waqf property. It differentiated the CEO's role under Section 40 (conducting an inquiry to gather prima facie evidence) from the Tribunal's role (adjudicating the dispute based on evidence). The Court reasoned that any challenge to the CEO's findings or procedure must be brought before the Tribunal, which is empowered to examine all aspects, including the fundamental question of whether the property constitutes Waqf.</p>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>FINAL VERDICT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The appeal filed by the Maharashtra State Board of Waqfs was allowed.</li>
                        <li>The judgment of the Bombay High Court was set aside.</li>
                        <li>It was reaffirmed that the Waqf Tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction to determine questions regarding whether a property is Waqf property.</li>
                        <li>Parties were directed to pursue their remedies before the appropriate Waqf Tribunal.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>Under the Waqf Act, 1995, particularly Sections 83 and 85, the Waqf Tribunal possesses exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any dispute, question, or matter relating to a Waqf or Waqf property. The jurisdiction of civil courts is expressly barred, and this bar extends to challenges against preliminary inquiries conducted by the CEO under Section 40, which must be contested before the Tribunal.</p>
