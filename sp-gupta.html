                <p>Popularly known as the <strong>First Judges Case</strong>, this complex litigation involved a batch of petitions filed primarily by lawyers challenging various aspects of judicial appointments and transfers. Key issues included the non-appointment of certain additional High Court judges as permanent judges, the transfer of High Court judges, and the government's refusal to disclose correspondence related to these decisions.</p>
                <p>The case crucially examined the meaning of "consultation" with the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and other judges under Articles 124(2) and 217(1) of the Constitution regarding judicial appointments. It also significantly broadened the concept of <strong>locus standi</strong> (the right to bring an action) in Public Interest Litigation (PIL).</p>

                            <h4>Second Judges Case (1993)</h4>
                            <p>SC overrules <em>S.P. Gupta</em> regarding executive primacy, establishing the Collegium system where the CJI's view has primacy.</p>

                </div>

                <p>In a voluminous judgment with seven separate opinions, the Supreme Court reached several key conclusions. Firstly, it significantly <strong>liberalized the rule of locus standi</strong>, allowing bona fide public-spirited individuals and organizations (like lawyers and bar associations) to approach the court regarding matters affecting the public interest, particularly judicial independence, even if they hadn't suffered direct personal injury. This gave a major boost to Public Interest Litigation (PIL).</p>
                <p>Secondly, regarding judicial appointments and transfers, the majority held that "consultation" under Articles 124 and 217 <strong>did not mean "concurrence."</strong> While the CJI's opinion should be given due weight, the ultimate decision rested with the Central Government (executive). This interpretation gave <strong>primacy to the executive</strong> in the appointment process. Thirdly, the Court largely rejected the government's claim of absolute privilege over disclosure of correspondence regarding appointments, allowing for disclosure in certain circumstances.</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>The judges extensively debated the balance between judicial independence and executive accountability. Justice Bhagwati's influential opinion strongly advocated for broadening locus standi to ensure access to justice for the disadvantaged and for matters of public importance. On the issue of consultation, the majority relied on the plain meaning of the word and past precedents (like <em>Sankalchand Sheth</em>), concluding that the Constitution did not intend to give the CJI a veto power. They reasoned that requiring concurrence would amount to rewriting the constitutional provision. While acknowledging the importance of judicial independence, the majority felt that the existing consultative process provided sufficient safeguards. This interpretation, however, was seen by many as weakening judicial independence by giving the executive the final say, leading to its eventual reconsideration in later cases.</p>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>FINAL VERDICT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The rule of <strong>locus standi</strong> was liberalized; lawyers and public-spirited individuals have standing to file PILs concerning judicial appointments/transfers and independence.</li>
                        <li>"Consultation" with the Chief Justice of India under Articles 124(2) and 217(1) does <strong>not</strong> mean "concurrence".</li>
                        <li>The opinion of the CJI does not have primacy; the <strong>Central Government (Executive)</strong> holds the final decision-making power in judicial appointments and transfers after due consultation.</li>
                        <li>The government's claim of absolute privilege over correspondence related to judicial appointments was largely rejected; disclosure could be ordered by the court in the interest of justice.</li>
                        <li>Specific orders regarding the non-appointed judges and transfers were passed based on the facts and the above principles.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>Any member of the public having sufficient interest can maintain an action for judicial redress for public injury (Public Interest Litigation), relaxing the traditional rule of locus standi. The term "consultation" used in Articles 124(2) and 217(1) does not imply concurrence; the Central Government is not bound by the opinion of the Chief Justice of India in matters of judicial appointments, although the opinion must be given due consideration. Judicial independence does not require primacy of the judiciary's opinion in the appointment process under the constitutional scheme.</p>
                     <p><em>(Note: The ratio regarding the meaning of "consultation" and executive primacy was explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court in the Second Judges Case - Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association v. Union of India, 1993.)</em></p>
