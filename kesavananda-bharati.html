                <p>Arguably the most important case in Indian constitutional history, Kesavananda Bharati challenged the validity of several constitutional amendments (24th, 25th, and 29th) enacted by Parliament, largely in response to the <em>Golaknath</em> decision. The petitioner, head of a religious mutt in Kerala, challenged these amendments and related state land reform laws affecting the mutt's property.</p>
                <p>The case was heard by the largest-ever bench (13 judges) and examined the fundamental question: What is the extent of Parliament's power to amend the Constitution under Article 368? Specifically, could Parliament alter, abridge, or abrogate Fundamental Rights or even change the core identity of the Constitution?</p>

                                <li>Parliament's amending power under Article 368 is not unlimited.</li>
                                <li>There are implied limitations; Parliament cannot destroy the "basic features" or "essential elements" of the Constitution.</li>
                                <li>Fundamental Rights are part of these basic features and cannot be abrogated, although reasonable restrictions are permissible.</li>
                                <li>The 24th, 25th (especially Article 31C), and 29th Amendments violate these basic features and should be struck down.</li>
                                <li>The <em>Golaknath</em> decision, while perhaps incorrect in its reasoning about Article 13(2), reached the right conclusion about the inviolability of Fundamental Rights.</li>

                                <li>The amendments (24th, 25th, 29th) were validly enacted to further socio-economic justice and overcome obstacles created by previous judicial interpretations.</li>

                            <p>By a 7:6 majority, SC lays down the Basic Structure Doctrine, limiting Parliament's amending power.</p>

                </div>

                <p>In a historic and complex judgment comprising 11 separate opinions, the Supreme Court, by a narrow 7:6 majority, established the <strong>Doctrine of Basic Structure</strong>. It overruled the <em>Golaknath</em> decision's finding that Parliament had <em>no</em> power to amend Fundamental Rights.</p>
                <p>However, the Court imposed a crucial limitation: while Parliament <em>can</em> amend any part of the Constitution, including Fundamental Rights, it <strong>cannot</strong> alter or destroy its "basic structure" or "essential features." The Court upheld the validity of the 24th Amendment (affirming Parliament's power to amend) and the first part of the 25th Amendment (revising property compensation), but struck down the second part of Article 31C inserted by the 25th Amendment (which barred judicial review), and subjected the 29th Amendment (adding laws to 9th Schedule) to the test of the Basic Structure doctrine.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>The 13 judges produced varied reasonings, but a majority converged on the principle of implied limitations. They reasoned that the word "amendment" in Article 368 implies improvement or modification, not destruction of the Constitution's core identity. While Parliament's constituent power was vast, it wasn't absolute. Justice H.R. Khanna's pivotal opinion bridged the gap: he agreed Parliament could amend Fundamental Rights (overruling Golaknath) but held that this power did not extend to destroying the Constitution's basic structure. The judges provided illustrative (but not exhaustive) examples of basic features, including supremacy of the Constitution, republican and democratic form of government, secular character, separation of powers, and federal structure. Fundamental Rights were also largely considered part of the basic structure, though the extent varied among judges.</p>

                    <h4>FINAL VERDICT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <em>Golaknath</em> decision was overruled.</li>
                        <li>Parliament has the power under Article 368 to amend any provision of the Constitution, including Fundamental Rights.</li>
                        <li>However, this power is <strong>not absolute</strong> and does not extend to altering the <strong>Basic Structure</strong> or framework of the Constitution.</li>
                        <li>The Constitution (24th Amendment) Act, 1971, was held valid.</li>
                        <li>The Constitution (25th Amendment) Act, 1971, was held valid, except for the second part of Article 31C which excluded judicial review.</li>
                        <li>The Constitution (29th Amendment) Act, 1972, was held valid, but laws added to the 9th Schedule under it would be subject to review based on the Basic Structure doctrine.</li>

                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>Article 368 does not enable Parliament to alter the <strong>basic structure</strong> or framework of the Constitution. While Parliament has the power to amend any part of the Constitution, including Fundamental Rights, this power is subject to the implied limitation that the amendment must not damage or destroy the essential features or basic foundation of the Constitution.</p>
