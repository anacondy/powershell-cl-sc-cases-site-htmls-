                <p>This case, along with other petitions, sought clarification and review of the Supreme Court's earlier landmark judgment in <em>Sarla Mudgal v. Union of India (1995)</em>. The <em>Sarla Mudgal</em> case had held that a Hindu husband, married under the Hindu Marriage Act, cannot escape the charge of bigamy (Section 494 IPC) by converting to Islam and marrying a second time.</p>
                <p>The petitioners in the Lily Thomas case argued that the <em>Sarla Mudgal</em> judgment was wrong, that it interfered with the freedom of religion (Article 25), and that a marriage under Hindu law is automatically dissolved upon conversion. They essentially asked the Court to overturn its previous ruling and hold that a second marriage after conversion is valid.</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>The judgment in <em>Sarla Mudgal</em> infringes on the fundamental right to freedom of religion (Article 25), including the right to convert and embrace a new faith (Islam) which permits polygamy.</li>
                                <li>Upon conversion from Hinduism to Islam, the first marriage under Hindu law stands dissolved, as Hindu law no longer applies to the convert.</li>
                                <li>Therefore, a second marriage contracted after conversion is not bigamous under Section 494 IPC, as the first marriage ceases to exist.</li>
                                <li>The <em>Sarla Mudgal</em> judgment was an incorrect interpretation of law and should be overruled.</li>

                                <li>The <em>Sarla Mudgal</em> judgment is correct and requires no reconsideration.</li>
                                <li>A marriage performed under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, can only be dissolved according to the specific grounds laid down in that Act (e.g., divorce decree).</li>
                                <li>A simple conversion by one party does <em>not</em> automatically dissolve the first marriage.</li>
                                <li>Therefore, the first marriage subsists, and a second marriage during its subsistence is void and punishable as bigamy under Section 494 IPC, regardless of the conversion.</li>
                                <li>Freedom of religion (Article 25) does not protect an act that is a crime under secular law (IPC).</li>

                            <p>The Supreme Court dismisses the petitions and strongly reaffirms the correctness of the <em>Sarla Mudgal</em> judgment.</p>
                            <span class="date">April 5, 2000</span>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>The Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, dismissed all the petitions and strongly <strong>reaffirmed</strong> its earlier ruling in <em>Sarla Mudgal</em>. The Court held that the law laid down in the previous case was correct and required no reconsideration.</p>
                <p>Justice S. Saghir Ahmad, writing the main judgment, clarified that a marriage celebrated under one personal law (Hindu Marriage Act) can only be dissolved according to the provisions of that law. The act of conversion to another religion (like Islam) by one spouse does <strong>not</strong> automatically dissolve the first marriage. As the first marriage remains valid and subsisting, contracting a second marriage (even under the rules of the new religion) is a direct violation of Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code (Bigamy) and is therefore void and punishable.</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>The Court's analysis focused on the sanctity of the first marriage and the application of secular criminal law. It held that the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, provides the only methods by which a Hindu marriage can be dissolved, and conversion is not one of them (though it is a <em>ground</em> on which the other spouse can seek divorce). The Court made it clear that Section 494 IPC is a secular law that applies to all citizens, and its operation is not barred by personal laws. Justice R.P. Sethi, in his concurring opinion, further emphasized that the right to freedom of religion (Article 25) does not grant a person the license to commit a crime (bigamy) or to infringe upon the rights of their existing spouse. The judgment sealed the legal position, preventing individuals from using religious conversion as a tool to bypass marital laws and commit bigamy.</p>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>FINAL VERDICT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The writ petitions and review petitions were dismissed.</li>
                        <li>The judgment in <em>Sarla Mudgal v. Union of India (1995)</em> was upheld as correct.</li>
                        <li>A marriage contracted under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, is not automatically dissolved upon one spouse's conversion to another religion.</li>
                        <li>A second marriage contracted by a Hindu husband after converting to Islam, while the first Hindu marriage remains subsisting (undissolved), is <strong>void</strong> and constitutes the offense of <strong>bigamy</strong> under Section 494 of the IPC.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>The first marriage, solemnized under a specific personal law (e.g., Hindu Marriage Act), continues to subsist in law unless dissolved by a decree of divorce under the provisions of that Act. The mere act of conversion to another religion by one spouse does not dissolve the first marriage. Therefore, a second marriage contracted by the convert during the subsistence of the first marriage is a violation of Section 494 of the IPC and is void. Freedom of religion under Article 25 does not extend to committing a criminal act like bigamy.</p>
