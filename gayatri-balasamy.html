                <p>This case settled a major conflict in arbitration law. The dispute arose from an arbitral award where the appellant (Gayatri Balasamy) was awarded a sum of money. The respondent company challenged this award under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. The Madras High Court, instead of just upholding or setting aside the award, <strong>modified</strong> it, reducing the amount payable to the appellant.</p>
                <p>The appellant challenged this modification in the Supreme Court. The core question was whether a court, when reviewing an arbitral award under Section 34 or Section 37 of the Act, has the power to <strong>modify, vary, or remit</strong> the award, or if its power is limited <em>only</em> to <strong>setting aside</strong> the award in whole or in part.</p>

                            <h4>Supreme Court Judgment</h4>
                            <p>The 3-judge bench unanimously holds that courts have no power to modify arbitral awards under Sections 34 or 37 of the Arbitration Act.</p>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>In a unanimous judgment authored by CJI D.Y. Chandrachud, the Supreme Court decisively settled the law, holding that a court's power under Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration Act is <strong>limited to setting aside an award</strong> (in whole or in part).</p>
                <p>The Court explicitly ruled that courts <strong>do not have the power to modify, vary, or remit</strong> (send back) an arbitral award to the arbitrator. The judgment emphasized that the 1996 Act was designed to ensure minimal judicial intervention. Allowing courts to modify awards would turn them into appellate courts, which defeats the entire purpose of arbitration. The Court <strong>overruled</strong> previous judgments, including parts of <em>Dyna Technologies</em>, that had suggested a power to modify or remit exists. The High Court's order modifying the award was set aside.</p>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>The Court's analysis focused on the "legislative policy" of the 1996 Arbitration Act. CJI Chandrachud noted that Section 34 strictly provides only for "setting aside" an award on limited grounds. Unlike the older 1940 Act, the 1996 Act deliberately omitted the power to "modify" or "remit" an award. The Court reasoned that judicial intervention should be minimal to respect the autonomy of the arbitral process and provide a speedy resolution. If a court finds an award partially illegal, it can only set aside that part; it cannot rewrite the award or substitute its own judgment. This judgment provides crucial clarity and reinforces the pro-arbitration, non-interventionist stance of Indian law.</p>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>FINAL VERDICT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The power of a court under Section 34 (challenge) and Section 37 (appeal) of the Arbitration Act, 1996, is limited to <strong>setting aside</strong> an arbitral award.</li>
                        <li>Courts <strong>do not have the power to modify, vary, or remit</strong> an arbitral award.</li>
                        <li>The judgment of the Madras High Court modifying the award was set aside.</li>
                        <li>The view in <em>Dyna Technologies</em> (2019) and other cases suggesting a power to modify or remit was held to be incorrect and was <strong>overruled</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>The legislative policy of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is to minimize judicial intervention in arbitral awards. The statutory scheme of Section 34 clearly and exclusively provides for "setting aside" an award on specified grounds. This power does not implicitly include the power to modify, vary, or remit the award, as such powers are not conferred by the statute. Allowing modification would violate the principle of party autonomy and convert the supervisory court into an appellate court.</p>
