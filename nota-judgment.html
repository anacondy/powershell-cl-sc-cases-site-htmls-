                <p>This Public Interest Litigation filed by PUCL sought to introduce a "None of the Above" (NOTA) option for voters in elections. The petitioners argued that the existing system forced a voter to choose one of the candidates, even if they found none of them suitable. The only way to officially register dissent was under <strong>Rule 49-O</strong> of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961.</p>
                <p>However, Rule 49-O required the voter to inform the Presiding Officer of their decision not to vote, who would then make an entry in a register. The petitioners argued this procedure violated the fundamental principle of the <strong>secrecy of the ballot</strong>, which is essential for free and fair elections and a part of the freedom of expression under Article 19(1)(a). They demanded a separate NOTA button on the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) to allow voters to reject all candidates in secrecy.</p>

                            <p>The 3-judge bench delivers a unanimous judgment directing the Election Commission to implement a NOTA button on EVMs and ballot papers.</p>

                <p>The Supreme Court delivered a unanimous and landmark judgment in favor of the petitioners. The Court held that the <strong>right to vote</strong> also includes the <strong>right to reject</strong> all candidates, which is a fundamental part of the voter's freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a).</p>
                <p>The Court found that <strong>Rule 49-O</strong> was <strong>unconstitutional</strong> because it violated the principle of secrecy of the ballot. It held that forcing a voter to disclose their choice of abstention to a polling officer was a form of intimidation and contravened the essence of free and fair elections. The Court, therefore, directed the Election Commission of India (ECI) to introduce a "None of the Above" (NOTA) button/option on all EVMs and ballot papers, allowing voters to register their dissent in secret.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading">COURT'S ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>Chief Justice Sathasivam's judgment emphasized that the right to reject candidates is a vital aspect of a vibrant democracy. It provides an outlet for voter dissatisfaction and sends a clear signal to political parties that they need to field better candidates. The Court declared that the secrecy of the ballot is paramount, as it ensures that the voter is free from any fear or coercion. By striking down Rule 49-O and mandating NOTA, the Court protected this secrecy for <em>all</em> voters, including those who wish to reject all candidates. The judgment affirmed that voting is not just a statutory right but a form of expression under Article 19(1)(a), thereby giving it a stronger constitutional foundation.</p>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>FINAL VERDICT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The right to vote, as a part of the freedom of speech and expression [Article 19(1)(a)], includes the <strong>right to reject</strong> all candidates.</li>
                        <li>Rule 49-O of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, was declared <strong>unconstitutional</strong> as it violated the secrecy of the ballot.</li>
                        <li>The Election Commission of India (ECI) was directed to provide a <strong>"None of the Above" (NOTA)</strong> option on all EVMs and ballot papers.</li>
                        <li>The Court held that a NOTA button would promote free and fair elections and increase voter participation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="small-font-section">
                    <h4>RATIO DECIDENDI</h4>
                    <p>The right of a voter to not vote for any candidate (right to reject) is a fundamental right flowing from the freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The secrecy of the ballot is an integral part of free and fair elections. Any procedure (like Rule 49-O) that requires a voter to disclose their choice of abstention violates this secrecy and is therefore unconstitutional. Providing a NOTA option is essential to protect the voter's right to expression and the secrecy of their vote.</p>
